### by Joshua Becker

### Principle #1: Be Convinced
Your actions follow your heart. You must first be convinced that this lifestyle is worth the effort

#### Benefit #1: Spend Less
Spending less is the secret to financial freedom

#### Benefit #2: Less Stress
Leo Babauta (Zen Habits), a minimalist home is less stressful. Clutter is visual distraction, less clutter = less stress.

#### Benefit #3: Easier to Clean
Less stuff to collect dust. Takes less time to put stuff away in the evening. Easier to keep closets tidy. (No whirlwind rush before the cleaner comes.)

#### Benefit #4: Freedom
No more stuff lying about with undone "work" attached to it.

#### Benefit #5: Good for the Environment
Honor your environment by taking care of it as much as you can. Consume less.

#### Benefit #6: Be More Productive
Our possessions consume our time, cleaning, buying, organizing, selling them. We can spend that time on more important things.

#### Benefit #7: Example for our Kids
Model: personal belongings are not the key to happiness.

#### Benefit #8: Financially Support Other Causes
Save money that can be furthered to other causes you believe in.

#### Benefit #9: Own Higher Quality Things
Owning fewer things = owning nicer things. Only keep/buy stuff you really love (rather than mediocre stuff you kinda like).

#### Benefit #10: Less Work for Someone Else
At the end of your life, someone will have to go through every single item and decide what to do with it.

### Principle #2: Make It Work for You
*Minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of anything that distracts from it.*

#### Rational Minimalism
1. We will intentionally promote the things we most value
2. We will remove all "clutter" from our lives
3. We will decorate in a minimalist style
4. We will use our money for things more valuable than physical possessions
5. We will live in a counter-cultural life that is attractive to others

### Principle #3: Jump Right In
*Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful. -- William Morris*
Start with a small, manageable job and work your way up.

#### Victory Leads to Victory
Start with the thing you can finish first, and let victory breed victory.

#### Minimalism Encourages Minimalism
After you've decluttered a space, anything out of place can no longer be left there.

#### Simplifying Any Space
Take everything out. Then sort by:
- **Keep it** Return it to where it goes
- **Move it** Move it to its new home immediately
- **Discard it** Sort it as to sell, to donate, to recycle or to throw away

#### Recognizing clutter
- Anything that is disorganized
- Anything you don't need or love
- Too much stuff in a small space

### Principle #4: Stop the Trend
*"You say: 'If I had a little more, I should be very satisfied.' You make a mistake. If you are not content with what you have, you would not be satisfied if it were doubled." -- Charles Spurgeon*

How to keep from making foolish decisions with your money?

- **Realize possessions do not equal joy**
- **Consider the true cost of your purchases** (in storage, credit, electricity use, time spent looking for the thing, productivity, losing or paying late on credit card bills...)
- **Understand the downside of consumerism** (producers' interests, less focus on social impact, damage to environment, upper classes benefit at the expense of lower classes)
- **Create a spending plan**
    + List your **monthly net income**
    + List all **fixed monthly costs** (rent/mortgage, charity, groceries, fuel, insurance, savings/retirement, utilities, credit payment, cable, phone, internet...)
    + Determine your **discretionary income**
    + Track your spending for a month or so to know if you're true to your list and you're not overspending or whether you need to cut some fixed costs to have more for a vacation, for example.
- **Become a Fan of the Invisible**
    + Remember that at the end of the year it's tax day and you wish you'd earned less or given more to charity. Remember that at the end of your life you wish you had had more time with friends and family.

### Principle #5: Persevere
*Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted. -- Albert Einstein*

Goals shape us and change us

1. **Recognize your "Clutter Collection Sites"** Clutter attracts clutter. 
    - Some things will need daily attention
    - Install "inboxes" (box for artwork from school, a tray for loose change or keys, a junk drawer)
    - Change your habits, find where a thing belongs and put it there
2. **Minimize your junk mail**
3. **Stay ahead of the game with clothing**
    - one-in, one-out policy
    - at the start of a season, turn all the hangers the other way, put them the usual way after you've used them. After a few months, get rid of the clothes you haven't used.
4. **Stay clutter-free with kids**
    - identify the toys they actually use
    - Purge often. Every time new toys come in, determine which toys go out.
    - A home for everything
    - Quality over quantity
5. **Be ready for the holidays/gifts**
    - We chose not to remove the joy that others receive from giving gifts
    - We made a point to give them lists
    - After a time, we purge again
6. **Think outside the box**
    - Buy things for their usefulness rather than their status
    - Reject anything that's producing an addiction in you (coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, chocolate, television...)
    - Develop a habit of giving things away
    - Refuse to be propagandized by modern gadgetry
    - Learn to enjoy things without owning them (library, park, museum...)
    - Develop a deeper appreciation for nature
    *The Freedom of Simplicity* by Richard Foster

### Principle #6: Share the Joy

By telling your story of decluttering.

### Principle #7: Simplify Everywhere
*You don't need to chase everything you've always wanted if you already have everything you need.*

Where else in your life can you remove distraction and focus on the essential?

- **time management**
- **the tyranny of the urgent** (book by Charles Hummel, 1967), vs the important. Important things are polite, they don't clamour for our attention but wait patiently. Set appropriate priorities.
- **plain, honest speech** Do what you say you'll do. Avoid flattery and half-truths. Don't use words to impress others.
- **television channels**
- **computer** (email, unused software, cluttered files, too complex software for your needs, facebook...)

## 15 Clutter Busting Routines for Any Family

[15 Clutter Busting Routines for Any Family](http://www.becomingminimalist.com/15-clutter-busting-routines-for-any-family/) - Joshua Becker

1. **Place junk mail immediately into a recycling bin**
2. **Store kitchen appliances out of sight** It takes less than 6 seconds to put each appliance away… once you’ve found a home for it that is.
3. **Remove 10 articles of clothing from your closet today** Have an ongoing box for goodwill ready.
4. **Fold clean clothes / Remove dirty clothes immediately**
5. **Kids’ bedroom toys live in the closet** Keep room in the closet, don't fill it up.
6. **Kids pick up their toys each evening**
    - teaches responsibility
    - helps them realize that more isn't always better
    - home is clean for mom and dad by bedtime
    - indicates that the day has come to an end
7. **Fill your containers for the garbage man** Use trash pickup day as an excuse to fill the bins or add another bag.
8. **Halve decorations**
9. **Wash dishes right away** Cups, breakfast... at least put them straight in the dishwasher
10. **Unmix and match cups, bowls, plates, and silverware** Nah. Just... no. Way too boring.
11. **Keep your desk clear and clean** Work surfaces are shareable, so leave them for the next person to use.
12. **Store your media out of sight**
13. **Always leave room in your coat closet** For guests, and so that it's easier to put stuff back in.
14. **Keep flat surfaces clear** After you clear them the first time, keeping them clean takes daily effort.
15. **Finish a magazine or newspaper. Process or recycle immediately**
